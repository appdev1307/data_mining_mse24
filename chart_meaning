## 📊 Step 6: Plot — What It Does

### 📍 **Code Block:**

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(
    data=rules,
    x='support',
    y='confidence',
    size='lift',
    hue='lift',
    palette='cool',
    sizes=(100, 800)
)
plt.title("GSE2361: FP-Growth Rules (Optimized)")
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## 📈 What Each Element Means

| Plot Element           | What It Represents                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **X-axis: Support**    | How often the rule occurs across all samples (e.g., `{GeneA, GeneB}` in 40%) |
| **Y-axis: Confidence** | How often the rule is true when condition is met (e.g., `GeneA → GeneB` 80%) |
| **Size of dot: Lift**  | How much more likely GeneB is if GeneA is present (vs. by chance)            |
| **Color (Hue): Lift**  | Same as size — higher lift = stronger rule                                   |
| **Each dot**           | One **association rule**, e.g., `{GeneA} → {GeneB}`                          |

## 🎯 Why This Plot Matters

It helps you **quickly identify the most meaningful and surprising gene co-expression patterns**:

### 🟢 **Big, bright dots**

* High support → common
* High confidence → reliable
* High lift → strong dependency
* ✅ These are the **best rules** biologically or statistically

### 🔴 **Tiny dots or low confidence**

* May be rare or weak relationships
* Use for exploratory insight only

## 🧠 Example Rule

Imagine a dot on the plot represents:

> `{TP53} → {BRCA1}`
> Support: 0.4
> Confidence: 0.85
> Lift: 2.1

This means:

* In 40% of samples, both are co-expressed
* In 85% of samples with TP53 expression, BRCA1 is also expressed
* This is 2.1× more likely than random chance → **strong rule**
